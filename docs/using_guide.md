### Add or subtract unit of a service pack

Assume the current total unit is 100, remain unit is 20:
- You want to add more 50 units to the service pack. Then you could edit the total unit from 100 to 150 and the remain unit will be 70. The total unit will be 150 after updated.
- You want to subtract 10 units out of the service pack. Then you could edit the total unit from 100 to 90 and the remain unit will be 10. The total unit will be 90 after updated.
