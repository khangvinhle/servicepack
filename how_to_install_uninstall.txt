How to Install:
0. Install OpenProject as normal.
1. In the terminal, run "gem install rake -v 12.3.1" (all strings in this file
are without double quotes)
2. In the file named "Gemfile", look for "group :opf_plugins"
3. Insert the string "gem 'openproject-service_packs', path: <replace this
with the directory of the mod>" in one separate line.
For example:
group :opf_plugins do
  gem 'openproject-service_packs', path: '~/servicepack'
end
4. From the OpenProject directory, run "bundle install && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec db:migrate"
5. Run "RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile"
6. Start OpenProject normally.
Service Packs should be on the Administration menu and Service Pack Assignment
should be on the left menu in the Project.

How to Uninstall:
1. In the file named "Gemfile", look for "openproject-service_packs"
2. Delete the line found.
3. Run "bundle install" in the terminal.
4. (Optional) To fully remove the plugin, remove tables named "service_pack_entries",
"mapping_rates", "assigns" then finally "service_packs".
